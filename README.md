# Parallel Programming Project

This project includes a parallelized version of the Merge Sort algorithm. For a detailed problem description - see **instructions.md**, for more information and analysis - see **report.pdf**.

## How to Run

Run `python3 run.py` in the root folder. The program will generate tests, execute the single-thread, std::threads, and openmp versions of the algorithm, and display the average execution time. By default, the parallel implementations run with **8 threads**.
